Code Updated Date: 10/27/21

Current Version: 0.2.8

Next Version: 0.2.9

Github Updated Date: 10/27/21 9:45 AM Eastern Time

Note: I have most of Version 0.2.9 complete. This version allow the game to be more adaptive to new features. Version 0.3.0 will be released after 0.2.9 with most of the dev locks removed. Version 0.3.0 may not be stable. I will work on stability on versions 0.3.1 and 0.3.2. New features are coming in version 0.2.9 and some of them will not even have anything in them. There are more chapters and new weapons in 0.2.9. I will make sure 0.3.0 has all of it's functions working before I release it but there will be things I miss. I will mainly ensure features are usable with little to no bugs. I will add notes in the update page if I notice something is not working as intended and they will be fixed in future versions if there is not sufficient time to complete the task. Thank you for being here for this version. Oh and this version has been done for sometime. I forgot to upload it sorry.
